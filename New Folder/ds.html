            If you're lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price tag. But I wasn't so lucky or connected my first 2 years so I'm here to help you out.
            First, plan out which shows are most important to you and make a schedule and this is a biggie: SET A BUDGET. 
            If you're worrying about blowing your cash the whole time you won't have fun.
            Then check out prices, days, and times and prioritize the designers you want to see most. 
            Lastly, purchase your tickets and get excited!
